# Txtgenerator

This is a text generator made up in processing for resolume !!! 

You need to copy the processing sketch into your resolume installation folder > plugins > vfx AND also have SPOUT and SPOUTcontrols installed in your PC.

*Make sure you have all your drivers up to date.
*download SPOUT program from here: http://spout.zeal.co/

You can change the values (MAX,MIN and standart) values in the Txtgenerator.txt. DON´T change the names though, the program won´t work if you do.
